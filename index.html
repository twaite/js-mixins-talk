            ## It's Imperative That You Stop Using Mixins

            - If you use react you've probably seen this article
            - This article explains some great alternatives, we will look at these
            - This talk is not about _how_ we can write our code, but rather about _why_ we want to write our code this way

            ### Declarative

            NOTE:
            - Today's talk is going to be focusing on this distinction, as it is the underlying reason that mixins can become problematic

            ### Imperative

            - Creating code that tells the computer how to do things. <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
            - Typically uses lots of conditionals, loops and inheritance <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
            - Example languages: C, C++, Java, Assembly <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

            ```javascript
              let count = 0;
              const increment = () => count++;

              increment();

              console.log(count); // 1
            ```
            <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

            NOTE:
            - Telling code _how_ to do things
            - Uses lots of conditionals, loops and inheratance
            - C, C++, Java, Assembly
            - Mutability

            ### What is a mixin?

            Mixins are a way to distribute reusable functionality for components. A mixin typically contains component options such as state, props, and lifecycle hooks.<br><br>When adding mixins to a component it will inherit all of these properties. <!-- .element class="fragment" -->.

            NOTE:
            - One last definition
            - What is a mixin?
            - This is my definition based loosely on the Vue and Ember docs

            ### So are mixins imperative or declarative?

            ```javascript
              import counterMixin from '@/mixins/counter-mixin.js'

              const MyComponent = {
                mixins: [counterMixin],
                // ...
              }
            ```

            NOTE:
            - We will be using Vue as an example, but this code is very similar to Ember or other alternatives
            - At first this seems to be declarative, after all we aren't telling it what to do
            - But remember that we are using inheritance, we are telling it _how_, but somewhere else

            ### Declarative Code is Descriptive

            What is this code actually doing?

            ```javascript
              import counterMixin from '@/mixins/counter-mixin.js'

              const MyComponent = {
                mixins: [counterMixin],
                // ...
              }
            ```

            NOTE:
            - This code is actually imperative
            - This code does not _declare_ what it's doing, it's very abstract
            - What methods and state, if any, does this add?
